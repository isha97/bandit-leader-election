Number of election rounds v/s number of requests (Deterministic, Randomized, Learning)
Number of messages transferred v/s number of requests
Number of election rounds v/s minimum fraction of failed nodes
Number of election rounds for uniform v/s imbalance
epsilon-greedy, UCB ,heuristic
number of nodes as factor



To Do:
1. Visualization
2. Uniform seeds
3. For randomized, set epsilon to 1

The paper will be graded on:
